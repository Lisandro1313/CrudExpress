# Express CRUD App Deployed on DigitalOcean App Platform

This is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built using Express.js for Node.js. The application allows you to manage a list of todos, demonstrating the basic functionalities of a RESTful API. The project includes instructions on how to deploy the application to the DigitalOcean App Platform, making it accessible online.

## Features

- Create new todos with a POST request.
- Retrieve all todos with a GET request.
- Update existing todos with a PUT request.
- Delete todos with a DELETE request.

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of RESTful APIs and Express.js.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Install the required dependencies using `npm install`.
4. Run the application locally using `node app.js`.
